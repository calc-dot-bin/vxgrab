This is a script that will download from VX-UG, specifically, everything in the section you linked to.




## Usage/Examples

```bash
python3 vxgrab.py <link> <destination>
```

You can also just enter a root VXUG URL and it will download **everything**. Do note, this is around 500gb and you probably do not want this.
